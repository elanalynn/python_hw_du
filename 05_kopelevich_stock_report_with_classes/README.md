This assignment builds on the previous assignment, incorporating classes and modules.

## Instructions

Using the previous assignment, set up your code to use classes. Set up the stock data variables as class attributes and functions as stock class methods. Create a class for the investor as well, and add an address and phone number component for them. Create an additional class for bonds. Bonds are similar to stocks, so set up the bond class to inherit from the stock class, but add coupon and yield attributes to it as well. Add method necessary to read the additional two values. Add ID fields in all the classes – for example investorID for the investor class and purchaseID for the stock and bond purchase records. Instantiate all the classes to the current information Bob Smith has.

Add a single bond to Bob Smith’s portfolio, with the following information:

Symbol: GT2:GOV
Purchase Price: 100.02
Current Price: 100.05
Quantity: 200
Coupon: 1.38
Yield: 1.35%
Purchase Date: 8/1/2017

Create a screen print out, just like you did before, but also add a bond section.
